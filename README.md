## Java Abstraction

`Abstract Classes and Methods`

Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.\
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).

The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
- Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
- Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
